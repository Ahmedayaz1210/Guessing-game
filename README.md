# ðŸŽ® Guessing Game

## Overview
The **Guessing Game** project is a Java-based interactive game that challenges players to guess a randomly generated number. This project highlights the implementation of a custom data structure called "Bag," which is designed to store and manage game-related data. The game utilizes both linked lists and arrays, providing a dynamic and engaging experience for users.

## Features and Functionalities

### Custom Data Structure: Bag
Developed a unique "Bag" data structure using both linked lists and arrays, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of game data. This demonstrates an understanding of data organization and management.

### Two Interfaces
Implemented two separate interfaces for the Bag structure: one utilizing linked lists and the other using arrays. This allows flexibility in how data is accessed and manipulated, showcasing design considerations in software development.

### Interactive Gameplay
Players engage in a guessing game where they must identify a randomly selected number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on each guess, enhancing the interactive experience.

## Methodology

### Data Structure Design
The "Bag" data structure was designed to handle dynamic data efficiently. Each implementation (linked list and array) provides unique advantages, demonstrating the versatility of data structures in game design.

### Game Logic
Implemented core game logic that manages user input, evaluates guesses, and provides real-time feedback, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience.

## Purpose
The **Guessing Game** project serves as a fun and educational tool, illustrating basic programming concepts and data structure implementation. It provides hands-on experience in creating interactive applications, making it a valuable exercise in Java development.
